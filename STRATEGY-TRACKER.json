AIRDROP OVERLAY: Opinion + Probable have weekly points epochs — volume generates airdrop tokens on top of arb profit. Probable points credited Mondays 00:00 UTC. AlertPilot ($100/mo) scans Polymarket+Opinion+Probable with Telegram alerts + AI rule-conflict detection. Risk: different resolution rules across platforms. Next steps: (1) Get Opinion + Probable API access, (2) manually scan 5 matched events for spread, (3) if viable, build cross-platform price monitor. CertiK reports 60% artificial volume on some platforms during airdrop periods = lots of competition but also confirms edge exists."
