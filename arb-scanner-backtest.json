  "keyFindings": [
    "ZERO viable arb opportunities found across 42 NegRisk events in ~1 day of data",
    "Most NegRisk events have YES sums ABOVE 1.0 (median 1.047), meaning the market overprices outcomes — the opposite of an arb opportunity",
    "The 3 events with sums below 1.0 had deviations of only 0.6%, 1.5%, and 1.6% — well below the 5% threshold",
    "Low-deviation events were low-volume sports markets ($6k-$183k), not exploitable at meaningful size",
    "Weather markets and high-volume sports consistently showed sums above 1.0 (vig/overround built in)"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Cannot access historical order book snapshots — only post-resolution prices with 1-day change estimates",
    "1-day price change is an UPPER BOUND on deviation since it includes the resolution move itself",
    "Only ~1 day of data covered due to API pagination limits vs high event volume",
    "Ask prices (what you'd actually pay) are higher than mid prices, making real execution even worse",
    "FOK fill rates unknown — partial fills on illiquid legs would create directional risk"
  ],
  "recommendation": "DISABLE_ARB_AUTO_EXECUTION",
  "reasoning": "The NegRisk arb strategy assumes markets frequently misprice multi-outcome events with YES sums below $0.95. In practice, Polymarket NegRisk markets show the OPPOSITE pattern: the built-in overround/vig means YES sums typically exceed $1.00. Even using generous pre-resolution estimates, zero opportunities exceeded the 5% threshold. The strategy has no edge at current parameter settings and would never execute."
