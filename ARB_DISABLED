ARB AUTO-EXECUTION DISABLED
============================
Date: 2026-02-13T12:48:00Z
Reason: Backtest found ZERO viable arb opportunities

Backtest scanned 42 NegRisk events (~1 day of data).
- 0 events had pre-resolution YES sum < 0.95 (5% profit threshold)
- 0 events had pre-resolution YES sum < 0.975 (2.5% flag threshold)
- Median YES sum was 1.047 (markets OVERPRICED, not underpriced)

The NegRisk arb strategy has no edge at current parameters.
Market maker vig ensures YES sums >= 1.0 in most cases.

To re-enable: delete this file and restart arb scanner.
See arb-scanner-backtest.json for full analysis.
